    <h1>Why you need to <span class=word title="take control of">take charge of</span> your English learning</h1>
    <div id=author>by Tomasz P. Szynalski</div>
    <div id=copyright>&copy; Tomasz P. Szynalski, Antimoon.com</div>
    
    <!--Why you need to take things into your own hands / take charge of your input-->
    
    <p>
    Before you can start speaking and writing in English, you have to <em class=em>learn
    <span class=word title="how people say things">how things are said</span> in English</em>.
    You do this by getting <a href="input-intro.htm" title="What is input and why you need it">input</a> &mdash;
    reading and listening to the correct English sentences of other people (ideally, native
    speakers). 
    </p><p>
    Most English learners get their input from English classes.
    In this article, I will <span class=word title="try to persuade you">argue</span> that English
    classes simply do not give you enough input to
    speak English fluently, and that you need to get English input outside of the classroom
    if you want to be fluent. I will also give two other reasons to
    <span class=word title="do it yourself">take things into your own hands</span>
    and get English input on your own.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Amount of input</h2>
    
    <aside>
    <ol class="footnotes bottom">
    <li>
    <span class=marker>1.</span>
    What do I mean by <i>fluency</i>? I mean being able to write and speak almost as easily
    — and almost as correctly — as in your native language.
    To be fluent, you don’t need to speak with a native-like accent and you don’t need to always
    choose the most natural way to say something.
    <li>
    <span class=marker>2.</span>
    By <i>pages</i>, I mean typical pages in a paperback book.
    <li>
    <span class=marker>3.</span>
    By <i>hours of audio</i>, I mean hours of <i>non-stop talking</i>, as in a radio interview.
    </ol>
    </aside>
    
    <p>
    To speak English fluently<sup>1</sup>, you need
    <b><a href="input-howmuch.htm" title="How much input do you need to speak English fluently?">a lot of input</a></b>.
    <em class=em>I</em> needed about 1,000,000 sentences over 3 years &mdash;
    on average, 6400 sentences per week &mdash; to get from basic reading skills and very poor
    speaking/writing skills to fluency. That’s <span class=word title="the same as">the equivalent of</span>
    60 pages<sup>2</sup> and 6 hours of audio<sup>3</sup> per week.
    </p><p>
    If you want to become fluent, the question you need to ask yourself is:
    <b>can English classes give me 60 pages and 6 hours of input per week</b>?
    A typical English course consists of 2 lessons a week, 1.5 hours each.
    But let’s assume you have the time and money to attend an <em class=em>intensive</em> course
    – 4 times a week, 1.5 hours each.
    </p><p>
    In such a course, you spend 6 hours per week in class.
    How much input are you getting? Let’s see:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Teachers <span class=word title="give">provide</span> little input. Most of them try to keep quiet and let the students talk. (This is supposed to help
    students speak sooner, but has the opposite effect.)
    When they speak, they speak quite slowly, with frequent pauses. 10 minutes of listening to a teacher
    gives you perhaps 5 minutes of “non-stop” input. In addition, some teachers like to switch to their native language
    instead of speaking English.
    <li>Other students also <span class=word title="give">provide</span> little input because they talk even more slowly
    than the teacher and they often make mistakes.
    <li>A lot of time is wasted on exercises that give you almost no input, for example:
    “divide these adjectives into two groups”, “rearrange the words to make a sentence” or
    “answer these questions about the text above”. There are also breaks, during which nothing happens.
    <li>If a text is read in class, it is typically very short (&lt; 3 pages).
    If a recording is played, it is short as well (&lt; 10 minutes).
    </ol>
    
    <p>
    If you consider all of the above, it becomes obvious that no more than
    1/3 of the total lesson time is spent listening to correct English sentences. This includes recordings
    played by the teacher and correct sentences spoken by the teacher and other students.
    What about reading? The average amount of text that you read
    in an English class is probably no more than 3 pages per 45-minute lesson (including texts in the textbook
    and teacher handouts).
    </p><p>
    If you <span class=word title="calculate the numbers">do the math</span>, an
    intensive English course gives you no more than 2 hours of spoken input and 24 pages of
    written input per week. That’s about 2,000 sentences per week.
    This means that it would take 9 years (with no breaks!) of
    intensive English courses to get 1,000,000 sentences.
    (With normal, twice-a-week courses it would take 18 years.)
    </p>
    
    <h2>Rate of input</h2>
    
    <p>
    Some of you may be thinking: “Great! So I will just take intensive
    courses for 9 years and become fluent in English!”
    Not so fast. You see, the total <em class=em>amount</em> of input is not everything.
    You also need the right <em class=em><span class=word title="speed">rate</span> of input</em>.
    A 100-meter walk is not the same as a 100-meter <span class=word title="fast run">dash</span>.
    </p><p>
    Why can’t you get your input slowly? Because of <b>forgetting</b>. Here’s how it works:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>When you learn a new word, it stays in your memory for some time (usually 1-30 days)
    and then you forget it.
    For example, let’s say the word is <i class=w>genuine</i> and it will stay in your memory for 14 days.
    <li>How can you remember the word for more than 14 days? You need to review it.
    If you see another sentence with the word <i class=w>genuine</i> in the next 14 days, your memory
    of the word will become stronger and you will remember it for a much longer time.
    <li>What is the chance that you will see another sentence with the word <i class=w>genuine</i>
    in the next 14 days? It depends on how many English sentences you will see in that period.
    If you get 4,000 sentences (intensive English course), the chance of
    <span class=word title="meeting; encountering">coming across</span> <i class=w>genuine</i>
    is about 3 times smaller than if you get 12,000 sentences.
    <li>Therefore, with less input, you are making it much more likely
    that the new word will be gone after 1-30 days.
    </ol>
    
    <p>
    So <b>if you’re getting your input slowly, you are hurting your progress in two
    completely separate ways</b>:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>You’re learning new things more slowly.
    <li>You’re accelerating forgetting. You’re losing “old things” more quickly because
    you’re not reviewing them often enough.
    </ol>
    
    <p>
    That is why a learner who gets 1,000,000 sentences over 9 years will
    <span class=word title="be much less successful">achieve much less</span>
    than a learner who gets 1,000,000 sentences over 3 years. The first learner will
    <span class=word title="will always be forgetting">keep forgetting</span>
    a large part of his knowledge because of
    <span class=word title="because he won't be getting enough reviews">insufficient</span> reviews. 
    The second learner will be getting more frequent reviews, so he will be losing less knowledge.
    </p><p>
    The <span class=word title="conclusion">bottom line</span> is that
    English courses – even intensive ones – simply give you input too slowly
    to <span class=word title="become fluent">achieve</span> fluency
    <span class=word title="I mean that it will take too long to achieve fluency">in a reasonable time</span> (if at all).
    If you want to speak fluent English, you have to
    <span class=word title="do it yourself">take things into your own hands</span> and
    <span class=word title="if you immerse yourself in water, you put your whole body in it">immerse yourself in</span>
    input &mdash; podcasts and audiobooks, videos and movies, websites and books.
    
    </p>
    <!--
    <p>
    Some of you may have thought about SuperMemo. SuperMemo is great because it virtually stops
    forgetting. However, it limits inflow of new material.
    - raw speed of adding new items
    - if you add too many new items, you will have to spend a lot of time on reviews.
    - motivation (more boring than input - content is not interesting, it's just disconnected sentences)
    </p>
    -->
    
    <h2>Fun</h2>
    
    <p>
    As I’ve explained above, I believe that getting input outside of the classroom is the only road to fluency.
    But there are reasons to get input on your own even if fluency is not your goal.
    </p><p>
    One such reason is fun. When you choose your own sources of input, you can choose
    things that you really <span class=word title="like very much">care about</span>.
    Instead of reading some random article in your English textbook,
    you can read a <i>Harry Potter</i> book, an e-mail message from a friend, an Internet forum with
    <span class=word title="advice on romantic relationships between a man and a woman">relationship</span>
    advice, or perhaps news about your favorite football club. Instead of listening to a boring recording
    in class, you can watch your favorite TV series or a video podcast about computer technology.
    </p><p>
    Now, of course, fun is good in itself; but it also has
    <span class=word title="good; helpful">beneficial</span> effects:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>If your input is fun, you get it much more
    <span class=word title="you want to get it much more">willingly</span> and <b>spend more time on it</b>.
    In fact, once you <span class=word title="try">get a taste of</span> all the
    <span class=word title="very good">amazing</span>
    <span class=word title="texts, movies, recordings, etc.">content</span> you can get in English, it may be
    difficult to <span class=word title="stop reading, listening or watching">tear yourself away</span>!
    <li>Fun leads to stronger memories. When you
    see or hear something that <span class=word title="is important">matters</span> to you,
    <b>you can remember much more</b>.
    For example, if you’re reading some article that your teacher gave you, you
    usually want to read it quickly and
    <span class=word title="finish the job">be done with it</span>.
    But suppose you’re reading the lyrics of a new song by your favorite band.
    <span class=word title="It is much more likely (=probable) that you will">You are much more likely to</span> repeat them to yourself and keep them in your memory — together
    with all the grammar and vocabulary!
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Authenticity</h2>
    <p>
    The final &mdash; and the least important &mdash; reason to <span class=word title="take control of">take charge of</span> your
    English learning is authenticity.
    I believe it is important to learn from real American and British
    <span class=word title="texts, movies, recordings, etc.">content</span> instead of
    resources prepared especially for English learners. If you hear something in a podcast
    or read it on a blog, <b>you know it is really used</b> in the English-speaking world.
    </p><p>
    By contrast, textbooks used in English classes often try to teach “proper” English,
    <span class=word title="without">stripped of</span> any informal expressions, such as <i class=w>crap</i>, <i class=w>sucks</i> or <i class=w>stuff</i>.
    Their authors probably disapprove of such phrases and believe that
    learners don’t need them.
    But most learners would choose relaxed, natural language — the language of
    regular educated Americans and Britons — over the
    artificial language of English textbooks.
    </p><p>
    A related problem is that English teaching is dominated by
    British English (at least here in Europe), while the real world is dominated by American English. Although in recent years
    British textbooks (and teachers) have started teaching
    American vocabulary, they still treat American English as a
    <span class=word title="someone or something unimportant">second-class citizen</span>.
    If you want to get an <span class=word title="correct">accurate</span> picture of the language used in the English-speaking world,
    you will need to go beyond English classes and start getting real-life input on your own.
